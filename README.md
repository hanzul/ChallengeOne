The goal of this project was to modify the existing HTML and CSS codes. The main HTML code had some issues and was not commented on as the best practice. Also, we should make sure the website follows web accessibility standards and processes in the optimization of search engines. 

During this project, I improved the HTML code and CSS on the syntax, as we comment on each section. I also added the second HTML and CSS page to this project, and I linked the main page to the newly added policy page. 

Moreover, I consolidated some of the CSS codes to I followed the semantic structure

Fixed areas :

- The HTML code for the search engine :"div id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization"". 

- Page titles were missing: <title>Harison</title>

- Comment on each section of the code. 

- I checked the output in different browsers such as Safari, google chrome, and firefox to make sure we have the same output. 

- I added a company privacy page. Users can click on the privacy link, and users will take to the new policy page. For this functionality, a new HTML and new CSS added to this project. 

- I verified all the landings work correctly after the user clicks on any links.
